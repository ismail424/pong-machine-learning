# Pong - Machine Learning

Normal pong game with ability to play against a bot trained by NEAT Algorithm.


### NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks. For a detailed description of the algorithm, you should probably go read some of Stanleyâ€™s papers on his website.

[You can read more about the algorithm here.](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html)
